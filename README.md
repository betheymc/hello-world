# hello-world
This is my first repository!
My name is Beth McIntosh, and I enjoy coding, and am learning more today.  
I'm doing college from home, kinda doing my own curriculum
Once I get all my Computer Science learning done I hope to get a job with it and have fun helping people out doing this stuff!
